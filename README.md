## User Stories
- As a user I want a username and password to log into the application. 
- As a non-registered user, I want to be able to create an account, so I can later have my personal profile in the application. 
- As a user, I want to be able to search for recipes based on the ingredients of my preference. 
- As a user, I want to have access to previous  recipes, which I have signed within my profile, so I can use them again. 
- As a user, I want to be able to log-out of my account, so somebody else can log-in.
